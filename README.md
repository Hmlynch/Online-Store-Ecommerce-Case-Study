# Online Store Ecommerce Case Study

## Project Description

The goal of this case study was to manipulate data about online consumer behavior and answer questions regarding the dataâ€™s story. This particular dataset was downloaded from Kaggle from the author Noro Chalise. The context behind the data is information regarding how consumers had made a transaction and what sort of groups/patterns got them to that conclusion. With knowing this information, I wrote out 12 questions regarding specific variables from the dataset and planned to answer them with graphs and visuals. The 12 questions are:

1. Does the date/year influence spending amount?
2. Do certain states spend more than others?
3. Does Marital status dictate membership segments?
4. What is the percentage breakdown between employee status?
5. What age group spends more than others, how does the payment method influence the ages spending?
6. Are Referrals worth investing into?
7. Should other payment methods be targeted and influenced?
8. How much of a difference are the different segments making?
9. In the varying states, which age group should be targeted, what percentage do they make up in the state?
10. Should we influence a gender for a specific segment?
11. What age group is worth referring to the online environment?
12. Which months are most profitable?

## Data Analysis Process

Once a key hypothesis was determined, then comes the data analysis process. This process is defined by 6 main methods: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act. Knowing the process allowed me to follow the steps of cleaning the data, mining for the answers, and creating visual graphs/charts to provide the patterns that were discovered in the data. This process was repeated through 5 different methods: Google Sheets, Bigquery/SQL, Python, RStudio, and Tableau for the visuals. Each method of analyzing the data was distinct but all came to the same conclusion in cleaning the data and finding what the questions were asking. The specifics about each method regarding installations, code work, and more are provided in the README.md files below (the README.md files are inside the individual method folders as well):
