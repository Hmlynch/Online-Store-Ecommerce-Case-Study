Format Date/Transaction_date,Made all the dates relevant to the month insead of the exact day/month/year
Format Date/Transaction_date,Removed all 2021 data since data only included half a year which would show bias to beginning months in analysis.
"Adding Rows/Transaction_year, Transaction_month",Added two rows including the year and month for further analysis dependent on those values.
Adding Row/Age_group,"For further analysis about a question about the ages, it would be simplar to just add them into age groups to do the analysis."
Removing Fromatting/ Referral Column,"Instead of having 0/1 being the values, I changed those values to be Not Referral/Referred to be more precise in langauge."
