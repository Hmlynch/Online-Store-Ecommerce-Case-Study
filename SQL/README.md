# BigQuery/SQL

### Purpose of Each Folder: 

##### Data Cleaning Process:
- This folder contains three different folders. The first is the Case study folder which includes the case study questions and the csv files that resulted from the queries. The second folder contains a csv file of the uncleaned data that had all null values removed from the dataset. And the last file which contains a csv file that removed all 2021 entires since the 2021 entries only contained half a years worth of data which would show data bias towards specific months. 

##### Uncleaned Data: 
- This folder only contains one file and the file is the original dataset used for this case study. 

### Installations:
